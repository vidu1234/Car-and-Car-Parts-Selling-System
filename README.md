✅ I made this Car & Car Parts Management system in my university's application development subject. The coding portion of this project was developed using Windows Form Applications and C#. It was found that both C# and WFA were very user-friendly and easy to use for developing web applications. So, this phase of development was completed very quickly and efficiently.
